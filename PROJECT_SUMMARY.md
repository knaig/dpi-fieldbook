# DPI Summit Fieldbook - Project Summary

## ✅ Project Complete

All 8 prompts have been successfully implemented into a fully functional Next.js application.

## 🎯 What Was Built

### 1. Base Project Setup ✓
- Next.js 16 with App Router and TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS with Inter font
- Dark header with "DPI Summit Fieldbook" title
- 5 main pages: Dashboard, Actors, Reflection, Import, Export
- Fixed bottom navigation bar with icons (mobile-friendly)
- All pages are client components

### 2. Data Model & Local Store ✓
- Created `types/actor.ts` with complete Actor interface
- Implemented `lib/useFieldbookStore.ts` with:
  - localStorage persistence
  - `addActor()`, `updateActor()`, `deleteActor()`, `mergeActorIntelligence()`
  - Safe hydration guards

### 3. Core Pages ✓
- **Dashboard** (`/`) - Shows stats, top 3 actors, unanswered questions
- **Actors List** (`/actors`) - Filterable list with add modal
- **Actor Detail** (`/actors/[id]`) - Full dossier with Summit Context, editable Notes, Intelligence Profile
- **Reflection** (`/reflect`) - Three prompts for daily reflection
- **Export** (`/export`) - JSON and Markdown export functionality
- **Import** (`/import`) - Parse summit data and add actors

### 4. Intelligence Enrichment ✓
- Created `/api/enrichActor/route.ts` with mock data
- "Enrich / Refresh Profile" button in actor detail pages
- Merges intelligence into actor profile
- Toast notifications for success/error

### 5. Import Parser ✓
- Created `lib/parseSummitInput.ts`
- Parses HTML/text from DPI Summit site
- Detects sector using keyword mapping
- Extracts summit context and source tags
- Preview table with checkboxes
- Bulk add functionality

### 6. Export Enhancements ✓
- Markdown export with comprehensive per-actor summaries:
  - Summit Context
  - Role in Ecosystem
  - Wants & Needs
  - How to Engage
  - Leverage for AI4Inclusion/AI4X
  - Next Action
- JSON export with full data
- Copy to clipboard functionality

### 7. UX Polish ✓
- Mobile-friendly forms and cards (`p-4`, `rounded-xl`)
- Success/error toasts (react-hot-toast)
- Color badges for sectors (blue=Gov, orange=Funder, green=Research, etc.)
- Offline-safe (everything client-side with localStorage)
- Smooth transitions and hover effects
- Active state indicators in navigation

### 8. Deployment Ready ✓
- Package.json configured
- README with instructions
- .gitignore setup
- Vercel-ready for deployment
