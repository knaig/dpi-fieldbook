# PWA Icons Needed

To complete the PWA setup, you need to create two icon files:

1. `/public/icon-192.png` - 192x192 pixels
2. `/public/icon-512.png` - 512x512 pixels

You can:
- Use a design tool to create app icons
- Use an online icon generator
- Or use placeholder icons for now

The icons should represent the DPI Summit Fieldbook application.

For now, the app will work without these icons, but they're needed for the full PWA experience.
