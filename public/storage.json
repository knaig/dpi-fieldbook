I have extensive experience in unusual and innovative procurement and supply chain. From 2011–2016, my work included engaging the private sector and network optimization in 5 provinces (Maputo City, Maputo Province, Inhambane, Sofala, Manica, and Nampula) to ensure medicine availability in more than 141 districts (out of 154 official) and providing technical assistance to implementing partners, working with public officials and the Mozambican Ministry of Health to implement outsourced transportation of pharmacy commodities from province to district and en route health facilities funded by DFID. My recent activities have included: 1) with GAVI, supporting the EPI team to implement and manage an outsourced maintenance project for all installed cold rooms and electrical equipment at central and provincial levels, later transitioned to the Central Medical Stores and Provincial Directorates; 2) with DFID, supporting the UK’s project “Linking Agribusiness and Nutrition in Mozambique” to improve quality of care and availability of nutrition commodities at the last mile in Inhambane (phased out), Sofala, Manica, and Tete, continuing with forecasting and procurement of nutrition products, supporting distribution from regional to provincial/intermediary warehouses, and implementing a case management strategy designated “Center of Excellence”; 3) leading digital health initiatives, including supporting bednet distribution microplanning through DHIS2, and currently coordinating the pilot and scale-up of the Digital Health Map for REDREC micro planning in Mozambique to improve equitable immunization coverage and strengthen data-driven health service planning.",

Attending the summit will provide insights into global best practices and regulatory frameworks that can inform our efforts to establish robust legal standards in Egypt.\n\n2. Understanding Ethical Implications: AI raises significant ethical questions regarding data usage, consent, and individual rights. Engaging with experts and thought leaders at the summit will enable me to better understand these ethical considerations and how they can be integrated into our national policies.\n\n3. Networking Opportunities: The summit offers a valuable platform to connect with other professionals, policymakers, and stakeholders in the field of data protection and AI governance. Building these relationships is crucial for collaborative efforts in shaping effective data protection strategies.\n\n4.Addressing Local Contexts: I am particularly interested in discussions that address the unique challenges faced by developing countries in implementing data protection measures. Gaining insights into how other nations are navigating these issues will help us tailor our approach to the Egyptian context.\n\n5.Staying Ahead of Trends: As technology evolves, so do the implications for data privacy and security.
